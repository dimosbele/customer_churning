An Application to the ”Churn” Problem

The goal is to predict which of the costumers are going to change telecommunication provider through algorithms of machine learning. We construct eight new features based on the given variables and we have tested five algorithms, xGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Trees and Multi-Layer Perceptron. The best score is achieved with the xGBoost algorithm, using all the available variables.
